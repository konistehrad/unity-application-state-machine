# Unity State Machine

A basic asynchronous state machine for managing application state within a Unity application.
This is meant to provide a set of examples and test cases surrounding the library itself,
which is found in `StateMachine`. Examples are found in the `Examples` directory, and tests within
`Tests`.

## Quickstart

Open the project in Unity, open the scene in `Examples/Scenes/Examples.html`. Hit start and 
evaluate how the states transition between each other, as you hit the "State A" - "State C"
buttons on the left.
